            <p>
              Dengue outbreaks in southern Taiwan are driven by climate and
              mosquito dynamics, but early-warning tools remain limited. This
              project builds a forecasting system for Kaohsiung, Tainan, and
              Pingtung using multi-source data to support timely public health
              action. By integrating climate, rainfall, and mosquito indicators,
              the system provides early signals of rising dengue risk, enabling
              faster response and improved resource planning.

        <p>
          This project builds an end-to-end forecasting pipeline that links
          multi-source dengue, climate, and mosquito surveillance data to
          city-specific models for Kaohsiung, Tainan, and Pingtung. Models are
          trained on 2010–2021 data and evaluated on a held-out 2022–2024 test
          window.
        </p>

        <!-- 2.1 End-to-End Pipeline -->
        <h3 class="results-subtitle">2.1 End-to-End Forecasting Pipeline</h3>
        <p>
          The workflow has four main stages: (1) raw data ingestion from Taiwan
          CDC, mosquito inspections, NCHC climate feeds, and population
          statistics; (2) local ETL and preprocessing to build a clean weekly
          city-level time series; (3) model training and validation using Random
          Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, and LSTM–Transformer; and (4) cloud storage of
          model artifacts in Supabase, which are then visualized in a Streamlit
          web app deployed on Render.

          2.2 Data Sources &amp; Database Management
        </h3>
        <p>
          Four primary datasets are integrated: (1) weekly dengue cases from
          Taiwan CDC (2010–2024); (2) mosquito larval indices (BI, HI, CI) from
          field inspections; (3) daily meteorological and rainfall data from
          NCHC; and (4) city-level population density derived from official
          statistics and ArcGIS enrichment. All raw data are cleaned and merged
          locally in Python. After training, model outputs, such as
          <code>predictions.csv</code>, <code>metrics.json</code>,
          <code>residuals.csv</code>, <code>history.csv</code>, and
          <code>feature_importance.csv</code>are uploaded to Supabase Cloud
          Storage. This centralized, versioned store allows the Streamlit app to
          retrieve artifacts on demand without re-running models.

        <p>
          Daily dengue, climate, and mosquito data are aggregated to weekly
          city-level time series to match epidemiological reporting cycles.
          Missing case counts are treated as true zeros, meteorological gaps are
          filled via time-based interpolation, and mosquito indices are
          forward/backward filled between inspections. Implausible sentinel
          values are removed and temperature consistency constraints (Tmin ≤
          Tmean ≤ Tmax) are enforced. For tree-based models, engineered lag
          features (1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15 weeks) are created for cases,
          rainfall, temperature, humidity, windspeed, and BI/HI/CI. Continuous
          variables are standardized with z-scores for Random Forest/XGBoost and
          Min–Max scaled for deep learning models.

          <ul class="nice-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Tree-based models dominate:</strong> Random Forest and
              XGBoost achieved the best performance in every city, providing
              stable forecasts even with limited outbreak history.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Deep learning struggles with spikes:</strong> LSTM-based
              models systematically underpredicted sharp epidemic peaks,
              especially in Tainan, and often produced negative R² values.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Recent case lags drive predictions:</strong>
              <code>cases_lag1</code> and nearby lags were consistently the most
              important features, with climatic and mosquito indices
              contributing more variably by region.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> For southern Taiwan’s
              episodic, highly skewed dengue dynamics, tree-based ML models are
              currently more reliable than LSTM architectures for early-warning
              forecasts.

            <p>
              This capstone project synthesizes skills developed throughout the
              16 months Business Data Analytics (BDA) program, including data
              engineering, statistical modeling, spatial analysis, machine
              learning, deep learning, and dashboard development. The project
              demonstrates the full analytics lifecycle from problem framing and
              data integration to modeling, evaluation, and deployment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond technical tools, the project reflects growth in
              communicating complex findings to non-technical stakeholders,
              designing interpretable models for public health, and building
              reproducible pipelines that can be extended in future research or
              operational systems.
